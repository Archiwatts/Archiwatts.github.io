    <h3>I love WandaVision<abbr title="postscript">ps</abbr>SPOILERS!!! if you havent watched it</h3>

    <p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/2/5/22268528/wandavision-episode-5-recap-pietro-evan-peters-mcu-implications">The Blog.</a>I got the next paragraph from.</p>

    <p>Here's a blog that breaks down Episode 5 of WandaVision. "Whew. The fifthepisode of WandaVision shifted not only the course ofthe remainder of the show’s only season—it potentially just altered thefuture of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe".</p>

      <p>"In the series’ biggest reveal yet, WandaVision closed this week’s wild episode by resurrecting Pietro Maximoff … from a completely different film franchise. As theever-observant Dr. Darcy Lewis notes in fourth-wall-breaking fashion, Pietro has beenrecast—Quicksilver is no longer being played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Instead, it’sEvan Peters who shows up at Wanda’s doorstep in the episode’s closing moments.Quicksilver is walking back into his sister’s life, years after his death, and atthe same time, the X-Men are finally entering the MCU".</p>

    <p>That gif was me when I first saw the episode. "My mind was absolutely blown" quote straight from me.</p>

    <!-- What to do!
    1.By now you should have installed and logged into GitHub Desktop on the
    computer you are using. If not, do that now.
    2.Log in to your account on the GitHub web site.
    3.Visit your repositories page by clicking the icon in the top, right corner
    of the GitHub web site, then select Your repositories.
    4.Click the green New button to create a new repository on the GitHub web
    site. Name it username.github.io (where username is your GitHub username).
    Type your username exactly as it appears; GitHub is case sensitive.
    5.For the description, enter https://username.github.io (again, where
    username is your GitHub username). Select the radio button next to Public.
    You can ignore all other settings. Click Create repository.
    6.In the Quick Setup section, click the Set up in Desktop button. An alert
    may appear in Firefox asking you to launch an application. Make sure GitHub
    Desktop is selected. Click Open Link. (If no alert pops up, proceed to
    Step 7.)
    7.When the GitHub Desktop application opens, a Clone a Repository window
    appears. Note the local path. This is where a directory will be saved on
    your computer. Click Clone.
    8.In your code editor, create a new file. Save it as index.html in the
    username.github.io folder you just saved to the computer. (Why index.html?
    If there are multiple files on a web site, the server looks for and
    displays index.html first. Otherwise, it will not know what page to load
    and return an error.)
    9.Create a simple web page. Build the document structure: a doctype, html,
    head and body tags. Don't forget to include the character set and title tag.
    Add your name wrapped in an h1 tag and include some content. Write a short
    paragraph ("This is my first web page!"), perhaps a list. Add some fun
    stuff if you would like. Use the opportunity to practice coding. It need
    not be complex.
    Save the octocat.png file from this site (see below) to the
    username.github.io folder on your computer. Add octocat.png to index.html
    using an img tag. (Do not forget the alt attribute!)
    When finished with your page, return to GitHub Desktop. In the left column,
    you will see checks next to two files -index.html and octocat.png.
    (You may uncheck .DS_Store if it exists.) Note these files are highlighted
    in green. This means new files have been added to username.github.io on
    your computer; orange means those files have changed. The panel on the
    right shows you the additions/deletions in the file.
    Below the list of files, add a short summary for the changes. Something
    like "My first commit." Adding a longer description is optional. Click
    Commit to master. In the top bar, click Publish Branch. This will upload
    your files to GitHub.
    Return to your web browser. Return to the page on GitHub with the details
    for username.github.io (again, where username is your GitHub username)
    repository you created. The files you committed should now appear.
    To view your web page, visit https://username.github.io (again, where
    username is your GitHub username). Your web page should be live!
    Submitting your work
    This is the part where most students who fail this assignment mess up. I do not
    know your respective GitHub usernames, so your work needs to be submitted to
    me for credit.
    Craft an email to erin.brown@miami.edu. Enter "GitHub Setup" as your subject.
    Include a link to your working web page — https://username.github.io
    (again, where username is your GitHub username) — not the GitHub web site
    showing the files in your repository.
